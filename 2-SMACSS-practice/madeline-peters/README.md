##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I used the guidelines to figure out where to put each selector. There were some overlaps for which I used my judgement.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

I did not do any refactoring. I could have for some of the overlapping selectors to make them more specific, but it did not seem necessary.
